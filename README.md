# ComfyUI SimpleFeed 
A simple, configurable, and extensible image feed module for ComfyUI. Originally proposed as a pull request to [ComfyUI Custom Scripts](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts), it was set aside due to the scale of the changes. This module only offers Image Tray functionality; if you prefer an alternative image tray, this one can be safely uninstalled without impacting your workflows.

## Configuration Options

### Settings
- **Visibility and Position:** Control the image feed's visibility and location.
- **Image Count Limit:** Limit the number of images displayed. If this is more than will fit on the screen, the image tray will scroll.
- **Sort Order:** Sort images by generation time, from oldest to newest or vice versa.

### Menu Options
- **Node Filter Button:** Filter which nodes contribute images to the feed, managing duplicates. When the filter is disabled, all image sources are included.
- **Clear Button:** This clears all images from the image tray. It does not remove them from your output folder.

### Lightbox Guide
- **Dynamic Updating:** Adds new images to the image feed as they're generated, dynamically updating the lightbox and its controls.
- **Navigation Arrows:** Color-coded arrows for functionality:
  - **Black:** Inactive when only a single image is present.
  - **Grey:** Navigate between images.
  - **Orange:** Indicates the end of the feed; wraps to the start.
- **Zoom and Pan:** Use the middle mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Hold Shift while scrolling to adjust zoom speed.
  - **Panning:** Enabled once an image exceeds the lightbox size. Click and drag to pan the image, with Shift + Click for faster panning.
